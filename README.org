* What is code review 

* Why is code review important 
Code review is important. To stress this importance let me open up with a quote from the founder of StackOverflow: 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I believe that peer code reviews are the single biggest thing you can
do to improve your code 

---Jeff Atwood (founder of StackOverflow) 
#+END_QUOTE
Here's another quote from Steve McConnell
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Individual inspections typically catch about 60% of all bugs/defects,
which is more than any other technique

---Steve McConnell (author of Code Complete)
